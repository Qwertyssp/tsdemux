tsdemux is (or rather, will be) a utility library for demultiplexing and
inspecting MPEG-2 Transport Streams, as used by DVB, ATSC, Blu-Ray and
AVCHD.

Its primary focus is in dealing with files on disk rather than capturing
and inspecting streams that are being broadcast -- as such, it makes no
particular claims with respect to performance.

tsdemux is very much a work in progress. It started out as a simple
command-line utility to dump packet data from a stream read from
standard input, and the decoding logic was later separated from the
utility itself.

All of the code is written from scratch, and I don't have access to the
ISO, Blu-Ray or AVCHD specifications. Google has been the primary reference
point, and the excellent work that others have done on GStreamer, MPlayer
and VLC have served as sanity-checks.
